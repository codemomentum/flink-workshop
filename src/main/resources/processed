Hi.

After 0.8-incubating, the default profile of hadoop is 2. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-1234 <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-1234>)
So, you don=E2=80=99t need to set hadoop 2 profile to build Flink for hadoop 2.
I tested with `mvn clean package -DskipTests` and the build result is success.

Hello Nils,

I am going to work on a similar issue related to tracking some basics
statistics of the intermediate results produced by dataflows during
execution.

I just create a Jira issue here:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-1297

If you already have some work done on extending the monitoring capabilities
in a branch, it might be good to sync-up the development in order to avoid
duplicated work (e.g. using the same communication channel used to send the
data from the task managers to the job manager).

Hi,


I have a small question about a custom partitioners.


I couldn't really find a method in the Java API which lets me partition the dataset in a total order.

Is that something that I just overlooked, or is that something not really supported?


The use case is writing out data so that it can be consumed by another tool. and also for quick human inspection

I can easily apply the sorting on a hash partition, but I would loose the total order, that all keys in partition one come after or before partition two etc.


PIG supports this by mapping the ORDER BY statement to 2 jobs. The first one samples the data to build a sketch to approximate the key distribution and then feds the result into the total order partitioner.


Thanks


Johannes

See if there is anything you can borrow from Akka Streaming API for Flink
Streams:
http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-stream-and-http-experimental/1.0-M2/scala.html

The DSL looks good and perhaps might stimulate some ideas.

Hi Fabian,

It is very helpful of your response! But in order to make sure I understand correctly, I put my pseudo-code here first:

class OuterJoinCoGroupFunction implements CoGroupFunction<Tuple2<String, Integer>, Tuple2<String, Double>, Double>{

    @Override
    public void coGroup(Iterable<Tuple2<String, Integer> > iVals, Iterable<Tuple2<String, Double> > dVals, Collector<Tuple2<Integer, Double> out){
        Set<Integer> ints =3D new HashSet<Integer>();

        for (Tuple2<String, Integer > > val : iVals){
            ints.add(val.f1);
        }

        if(ints.isEmpty()){
            ints.add(NULL);
        }

        for (Tuple2<String, Double> val : dVals){
            for (Integer i : ints){
                out.collect(new Tuple2(i, val.f1));
            }
        }
      }
  }
The code above try to builds the matching pairs and if one of the group is empty, I append the NULL value to it. However, I don=A1=AFt really understand how to implement the OuterJoinMapFunction. =20

I am also puzzled about how the Reduce/GroupReduce translated into Map -> Reduce. Where can I found the materials or the source code about this?

Hey,

I have started developing the scala api for streaming on this git branch:

https://github.com/mbalassi/incubator-flink/tree/scala-api <https://github.com/mbalassi/incubator-flink/tree/scala-api> (you can try it out)

I have done some refactoring in the java api to make it easier and already implemented some very basic functionality for the scala api (some simple sources and the map transformation). It will basically be copy pasting and modifying  Aljoscha=E2=80=99s code (a lot of credit goes there) so there will be a lot of functionality added in the upcoming few days. Marton and Paris will also help in but everyone is welcome.

Also does anyone know how to set max line length for the eclipse scala formatter?=20

Great! I had been waiting for the merging akka code to master branch.
After merging akka code, I can rebase code solving FLINK-1179 on master branch.

Thanks.

Hey,=20

Thanks Till for the description, I actually thought that I had the things set already what you described since I have been working on the scala code anyways.=20

It turned out that the xplugin path self updated itself by pasting my workspace path in front of path. So when I checked if I have everything set it looked good since the beginning of the path is same but was actually an invalid=E2=80=A6

Sorry I missed that somehow

+1.  Some quotes from my email to the PPMC on this topic:

The project has successfully made two [I stand corrected, three] Apache 
releases and added new committers.  The community seems to be good at 
welcoming new contributors, based on the interactions on the mailing 
lists.  The core team members seem to have quickly picked up the need to 
make the mailing lists the medium of discussion and collaboration.

I asked myself if there was any benefit to the community in staying in 
incubation longer, and I could not think of any.

Hi all,

I'm working on a small project for university and I have some question 
about how to implement it. Maybe you could give me some hints....

I have a directory that contains around 1 million HTML files. Basically, 
I just want to read each file entirely into a String and parse it with 
JSoup in a Mapper. Do we have a InputFormat that can be used for this 
use case or do I have to implement my own FileInputFormat for that? :/ 
In general: Do you think creating InputSplits of the directory will work 
properly with 1 million FileStatus'es?


Regards,
Timo

Additional Notes from the meeting:

The board observed that several projects would like advice on how they might re-invigorate a community that has slowed its pace of growth and development.

Hey Wilson,

the MapFunction should act as a wrapper for the join function. create a
class extending RichMapFunction, and pass the joinfunction via the
constructor. then you delegate open/close calls to it, with the map
function looking something like this:

map(Tuple2<...> tuple) {
return joinFunction.join(tuple.f0, tuple.f1);
}

Regards,
Chesnay

Hello,

It seems that Avro fails to serialise POJOs that contain non-String or stringable keys<https://apache.googlesource.com/avro/+/40650540dcb8ca8a6b6235de5cdd36c0f6e2eb31/lang/java/avro/src/main/java/org/apache/avro/reflect/ReflectData.java#361>.
eg. in the example here<https://github.com/senorcarbone/incubator-flink/blob/72b6798b50396c962fc6cea20a2bcdd51eec06f4/flink-examples/flink-java-examples/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/examples/java/testing/LongMapKeyIssueExample.java> I get a compiler exception caused by:

org.apache.avro.AvroTypeException: Map key class not String: class java.lang.Long

Is there any known workaround/recommendation for this except for using String keys?
I need this for a use case of low latency data-intensive streaming so String conversions should be avoided.

Paris

Hi,

I am trying to pick up the outer join operator. However, as Fabian mentioned to me, that this task would require to touch many different components of the system, it would be a challenge job for me. Therefore I would need some help:-)

I might need to walk through some features like Compiler/Optimizer and Runtime(as Fabian mentioned to me), so where should I start to get familiar?

One more thing, is the outer join operator implementation similar to the pure join operator?

Best,

+1

And I would also like to add on the Eclipse setup side that, you should need to watch out when installing the Scala IDE plugin, because the one offered in the marketplace is for 2.11. And also if you install the one for 2.10 it will say that there is an update (which again is 2.11). And this can cause weird errors.

There is a newer(than the one listed on the link setup doc) stable version available that worked for me:

Hey guys,

Since the last Akka update pull request from Till, I am getting a lot of
import errors (AkkaUtils, and other related packages) in Eclipse and I
cannot build the project. With Eclipse Luna there is no chance it gives
like a 100 erros. With the eclipse scala ide based on Kepler I still get
scala compilation and import errors.

For instance:

in TypeInfomrationGen.scala:
"value q is not member of StringContext"


Any ideas what could cause these and how to fix it?
Is there anyone who can actually build this in eclipse?

Cheers,
Gyula

Hey guys,

I am sure everyone is very busy with Christmas stuff, but if you are
getting bored try out the brand new Streaming Scala API.

I have opened a PR for it here:
https://github.com/apache/incubator-flink/pull/275

Basically everything works, but I still need to do some finishing touches.

I will probably add an example to the scala-examples package tomorrow but
it is getting very late (early) today :)

Happy Holidays!
Gyula

Hey all,

For tomorrow's hangout Paris wrote us a nice summary of our current plans
for the streaming api.

You can find it here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qwhELe_sc3acULAC9bwRCTAcvmoriU5Cb727LWPOK0s/edit

It would be helpful if everyone could go through the points so it is easier
to discuss afterwards. Feel free to add any comments even before the
hangout.

We will post a hangout link too eventually :D

Cheers,
Gyula

Hey,

The easiest fix for the eclipse issues is to avoid using luna and instead
use the eclipse scala-ide (which you can also use for java development,
this is what I do). This is basically an eclipse kepler with preinstalled
scala plugins which are actually working.

You can download it from here:
http://scala-ide.org/download/prev-stable.html

Make sure you download the version for Scala 2.10
<http://download.scala-ide.org/sdk/helium/e38/scala210/stable/site>.

When you imported the project the last thing to do is to set the compiler
plugin for the flink-scala project as described by till:
" You have to specify it in Properties (Module) -> Scala compiler ->
Advanced -> Xplugin.
You should find the paradise jar in your local maven repository, if you
built the project at least once with maven: Something like
~/.m2/repository/org/scalamacros/paradise_2.10.4/2.
0.1/paradise_2.10.4-2.0.1.jar."

I hope this helps, worked fine for me and others.

Cheers,
Gyula

Hey All,

I have created a google hangout for today's Streaming discussion:
https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/gws3f77u5fee5euehtw7zwob2qa

As we have agreed we will start today at 17:30 CET / 08:30 PST and I think
we'll be around for those who can only join later as well.

Please find the topics here
<https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Flink+Streaming>.

Hey Henry,

(I am resending this mail because it seems it didnt make it through the
mail system)

I suggest to have a public hangout sometimes on the current work we are
doing and our plans on streaming.

We have actually put together a list of topics that we want to work on next
year as we will have a quite large Flink team at SICS from January: Paris,
Jonas, Me and later Vasia.

Basically the topics are:
- Windowing semantics and multiquery optimisations (thats mainly Jonas'
thesis topic)
- Different fault tolerance approaches
- Connecting batch and streaming api ('lambda')
- Streaming graph algorithms
- Samoa for Flink (and streaming machine learning in general)

So lets start a series of public hangout calls to discuss these topics, I
would suggest one sometimes next week when it is suitable.

Regards,
Gyula

Hi Johannes,

right now the is no straight-forward way to write data in total order in
Flink.

The engine allows to locally sort data before it is given to a data sink.
However, this is not exposed to the API right now but should be fairly easy
to add (FLINK-1105). Given this feature, you can have a total order with a
data sink with DOP=1 (obviously, that doesn't work for large output....).
Flink recently added custom partitioners which can be used for manual range
partitioning if you know the distribution of the sort keys. Unfortunately,
custom partitioners are not documented, yet (FLINK-1260), see the PR for
information: https://github.com/apache/incubator-flink/pull/207.

For automatically fully sorted output, Flink would need to derive the
distribution itself just as you described for PIG. This would be a
non-trivial change.

tldr;
With FLINK-1105 fixed and a custom partitioner (given you know the
distribution), you can have totally ordered output in parallel.

I agree with Ufuk.

+1 for putting this out as a minor release (0.7.1).

Hi,

I'm +1 for
- merging the batch API modules
- having streaming top-level when the contributors think it's ready

I have a question though. Why did the streaming Scala API into the batch
Scala API module?
Are there dependency (or other) problems or could it be moved to the other
streaming modules?
Since there are no concrete plans (that I'm aware of) to do the refactoring
soon, I would avoid to have the streaming and batch APIs mixed if there's
not a good reason for that.

Cheers, Fabian

--001a113327a20bf5dd050a3db698
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

That's a good point.

You can implement an outer join using the available runtime. This way you
do not need to touch the optimizer and runtime but only the API layer.
This basically means to add syntactic sugar to the available API. The API
will translate the outer join into a CoGroup which builds all pairs of
joining elements and a Map which applies the join function to each joined
pair.

It could look like this:

DataSet<TypeX> in1;
DataSet<TypeY> in2;
in1.outerJoin(in2).where(...).equalTo(...).with(new MyJoinFunction)

which would be translated into

in1.coGroup(in2).where(...).equalTo(...).with(new
OuterJoinCoGroupFunction).map(new OuterJoinMapFunction(MyJoinFunction));

OJCoGroupFunction and OJMapFunction are functions that you need to
implement.
OJCoGroupFunction does what Stephan said (it builds pairs of matching
elements) and returns a Tuple2<TypeX, TypeY>.
OJMapFunction unpacks the Tuple2<TypeX, TypeY> and calls the user's Join
function (MyJoinFunction).

There are a few operators implemented this way. For example have a look at
the Reduce/GroupReduce with KeySelectors which are translated into Map ->
Reduce  (or Map -> GroupReduce).

Let us know, if you have any questions!

Cheers, Fabian

Hi Wilson,

the OuterJoinMapFunction can be done, just as Chesnay said.
Initialise it with a JoinFunction object in the constructor and call its
join() function in the map() call.
You can also pass the JoinFunction directly to the CoGroupFunction and call
it in cogroup() instead of building the Tuple2<In1, In2> pairs. Then you do
not need the MapFunction and things might be easier and cleaner.

The code of the OuterJoinCoGroupFunction looks good, except that you should
rather use an ArrayList<Tuple2<String, Integer>> instead of a
HashSet<Integer> in case that the first input contains duplicate values.

Let me know, if you have any other questions.
Cheers, Fabian

Hi Flavio,

we have a few recently started efforts to implement the collection of
monitoring and runtime/data statistics.
Counting the number of elements emitted by an operator (or data source)
will be included.

Do you want to count the number of produced tuples for monitoring the
progress or do you see a different use case?

Yes, sure.
Tracking records per split and UDF exec time per call (min, max, avg, or
histogram) would be valuable information when debugging the performance of
a program.

I see mainly two use cases to locally collect data on TMs and send it (and
aggregate it) on the JM.

1) Monitoring of the system and running jobs: This might include system
stats (CPU, disk usage, network traffic & buffer usage, internal memory
utilization, ...) but also progress information (number of processed
elements, histogram of UDF in/out ratio, UDF exec times, etc.).
2) Statistics collection for optimization: Stats would include key counts &
distributions, record count & sizes, UDF stats (in/out ratio, exec times,
...). Depending on the expertise of the user, this information could also
be valuable monitoring information.

In both cases, we need a service to ship collected data from the TMs to the
JM and aggregated and store it there.
Once this service is in place, the collection of metrics could be
independently implemented.

If we include the commit

[runtime] CaseClassSerializer correctly treated as stateful
f66892d46d80d453a55fd0ae14095ee06275a55d

then we also have to include

3d242fd7aea6add18465d628a258be11def2d0af

because the ScalaCsvInputFormat using the CaseClassSerializer won't work
properly anymore with the CaseClassSerializer set to be stateful.

Hi Gyula,

I just tried to build the current master with Eclipse Luna and the ScalaIDE
4.0.0 and it worked. What you have to make sure is that the Scala compiler
for the sub modules requiring Scala is set to Scala 2.10. This is
configured under Properties (Module) -> Scala Compiler. Otherwise you get
errors saying that a library is build for a wrong Scala version (namely
2.10). The sub modules requiring a Scala nature are flink-runtime,
flink-scala, flink-scala-examples, flink-test-utils and flink-tests, if I'm
not mistaken.

The second thing are the quasi quotes in the flink-scala module. Either you
simply close the project and everything should work or you add the required
Scala macro plugin paradise_2.10.4-2.0.1.jar to the compiler. You have to
specify it in Properties (Module) -> Scala compiler -> Advanced -> Xplugin.
You should find the paradise jar in your local maven repository, if you
built the project at least once with maven: Something like
~/.m2/repository/org/scalamacros/paradise_2.10.4/2.0.1/paradise_2.10.4-2.0.1.jar.
That is basically the same thing you have to do in IntelliJ as well to be
able to compile the flink-scala module out of IntelliJ.

I hope this solves your problems with Eclipse and sorry for the trouble I
caused you with my changes.

Greets,

Till

Hi Vikas,

welcome to the Flink project. It's great to hear that you want to get
involved in the Flink project. It's a good choice. First of all, I'd
recommend you to read the how to contribute guide [1]. The basic steps of
how to setup git and how to contribute code to the community are described.
Afterwards, you'll find possible starter issues in [2]. These starter
issues are a good way to familiarise yourself with the system and to get
ready to tackle bigger issues later on. You can also follow the dev mailing
list where all bigger issues are discussed.

[1] http://flink.incubator.apache.org/how-to-contribute.html
[2]
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-992?jql=project%20%3D%20FLINK%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20starter%20AND%20status%20in%20(Open%2C%20Reopened)

Best regards,

Till

In my specific use case I was intererested in understanding why the scans
of the splits were taking a long time, so I was intrested in getting
statistics about the number of records contained in each split and the
rate/speed of its reading..do you think it could be something useful in
general?

This is another way to do it.

I just created a JIRA issue for that:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-1297

If you can give me some pointers and suggest implementation strategies I
can try to prototype something in a feature branch over the weekend and
share it for review.

I checked the thread. I am not sure whether this is aligned with what I
want to contribute.

The discussion in the other thread seems to be going in the direction of
general-purpose monitoring (you are talking about Disk + Network IO, input
splits).

I would like to have a very thin code base that can be (1) transparently
injected in UDFs (if you can manipulate the AST), or wrapped in identity
mappers (if you cannot) in order to gather collection statistics (min, max,
distinct, maybe some histograms) to facilitate incremental optimization.

I agree that this should be based on existing infrastructure (Akka) and
should not be over over-engineered.

I will announce this in the other branch and create a JIRA ticket to fix
the parameters of what has to be done and the best way to implement it with
the other contributors.

Just a quick shout to check whether somebody is already working on a
statistics collection component?

If yes, can you point me to previous discussions in the mailing list and a
WIP branch -- I want to bring myself up to date with the ongoing efforts.

If not, I would like to start working on that component and ideally
integrate some parts of it in the 0.8 release.

Cheers!

I have created an issue for the related dataflow statistics tracking
feature here:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-1297

FLINK-456 seems to have some overlap with what I described. I suggest to
either have three separate issues or at least work on resolving FLINK-1297
and FLINK-456 in three stages:

1. agree upon a design and implement the basic service architecture and the
model;
2. implement dataflow statistics tracking on top of (1): min, max, count,
count distinct;
3. implement runtime statistics tracking on top of (1): CPU, I/O load;

It makes sense to have a design document (probably Markdown) with some
figures to agree on the scope and implementation aspects on (1) as Henry
Proposed in the "Statistics collection for optimization" thread before we
start with the actual implementation.

Robert's prototype branch (
https://github.com/rmetzger/incubator-flink/tree/flink456) on top of the
latest version of Till's Akka rework seems to be a good starting point to
fork for the actual work on (1). I suggest that after that we somehow
divide and conquer (2) and (3).

Alexander

Thanks Robert, looks like we could use this JIRA to do the work

Hi,
I'm one of the developers of SAMOA and I'd be happy to participate as well.
How should I connect?

Thanks,

Thanks for the recap, and sorry for being unable to join in the end.

If there is anything I can do to help with the integration of SAMOA don't
hesitate to ask.

Hey,

I have noticed that when I search for an issue (e.g., Google search for
FLINK-1281) the issues.apache.org/jira/... page does not typically show up
(the mailing list archives do).

For me it is actually more convenient to use Google search than the search
in JIRA :-)

Does anyone have any clue whether we can do something about that?

Kostas

Hi everyone,

It seems that everyone is excited about graduating, so I am calling for a
community vote to graduate Apache Flink (incubating) to a top-level project
(TLP). If this VOTE proceeds successfully, I will start a similar VOTE
thread in the Incubator mailing list, and if that goes well, we will submit
the resolution below to be included in the agenda of the next Apache board
meeting. I will keep this vote open until Tuesday.

[  ] +1 Graduate Apache Flink (incubating) according to the resolution below
[  ] +0 Don't care
[  ] -1 Don't graduate Apache Flink (incubating) according to the
resolution below because...

I will close this VOTE on Tuesday, December 9, 12:00pm CET.

Remember, this is a community vote, so everyone can vote!

Best,
Kostas

Super!

Paris and Jonas have been doing a lot of "silent" work (=3D not very visible
in the mailing list) recently. Looking forward to seeing this coming in.

Fabian told me that he recently looked into the Java JMX infrastructure.
Once we have the metrics collection integrated into the JobManager, we can
expose these numbers via a JMX service by the JM. Ganglia (and other tools)
can connect to the JMX interface to retrieve metrics.

But I the first step is certainly to get the infrastructure inside our
system in place.

I've worked on adding Kryo support to Flink today. I would really like to
include this into the release. Many users were complaining about this (
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-610).

I've based my work on top of Timo's pull request. If we're not going to
merge it, I will have to rebase my code to the current master. ... I'll try
and see if its easily doable.

I'm voting to release the current master as Flink 0.8.0.

Once we have merged these two major changes (
https://github.com/apache/incubator-flink/pull/149,
https://github.com/apache/incubator-flink/pull/254) in the queue we will
need some time until we reach a well tested, stable state again.

Hi,

it is indeed a bit annoying to work in parts of the system where you need
classes from both systems. But I think thats "only" the case in the YARN,
Hadoop Compat and FileSystem code.
I'm not sure if its a good idea to rename classes such as "Configuration"
or "Path", which are used everywhere in the system. Having a
"FlinkConfiguration" or a "FlinkPath" is just annoying to type (you have to
at least write "FlinkCo" for the autocomplete to recognize it (instead of
"Co").

A cleaner approach would actually be to use the Hadoop classes itself in
our system (the FileSystem, Path, FSDataInputStream etc.). However after my
experience with the YARN client I'm against this. Hadoop had some annoying
bugs where some methods caused OutOfBoundsExceptions etc. and I had to
manually implement them (it was just a utility method).

Scala users can rename the classes at import time.

To sum it up: I'm against changing this right now. We have two 10k+ changes
pending and the cases where the names conflict are too rare.
But I'm open to change my mind if somebody has more arguments.

The thread mentioned by Ufuk is an ongoing discussion, thats why there is
no JIRA yet.
To my understanding, its a student doing a project on Flink.

Also, I would like to give you the same advice I already gave to Nils: I
would highly recommend using Till's Akka branch for starting to work on
that.

Hi,

Sorry that you ran into that issue. The problem is that the "fat jar
builder" is removing all packages in the "org.apache.flink" namespace.
Moving the class containing the main() to a new location (say
net.internetmemory) will probably resolve the issue.

Best,
Robert

I've played a bit around earlier today and registered #flink at Freenode's
ChanServ. If everybody here want to go for #apacheflink, we can register it
as well.
I don't know if anything else is required for a good irc channel. I though
about adding a bot which is logging the conversations.

I looked through the commits since the last release and there is a huge
amount of improvements we could include.
I was thinking about limiting the commits for the bugfix release to a
absolute minimum. Only those issues users complained about or cause the
system not to work at all should be included in my opinion.
I would not include issues that cause bad performance, fix testcases or
code-style. I would rather prefer to aim for a 0.8 release soon (maybe a
Christmas or new year release ;) )

These are my candidates:

[FLINK-1154] Quickfix to kill TaskManagers in YARN mode.
 e46d14b4c7507b23f2c80e0d893cfff6f6c49bae
[runtime] CaseClassSerializer correctly treated as stateful
f66892d46d80d453a55fd0ae14095ee06275a55d
[runtime] Quick fix for error with unsupported ship strategy
87497b7235088b2220aa356a14cbff9d43d5dffb
[FLINK-1265] Fix user classloader bug for registerInputOutput() method
4a74f3281bd04ed76b911d2038ea8e3d9c0b7963
[FLINK-1252] Add support for serializing Date and Enums in the Java API
591f16dd8f80cc2a5b2fdc6654c3c2d625119faa
[FLINK-1251] Enums are now handled properly by the collection input format
8081ddc530e6c7b720da09ac0fca2095d70fdd36
[FLINK-1254] [compiler] Fix compiler bug for pipeline breaker placement
ce822bf7f5ec80df5d5a749b1439320af3fb8b18
[streaming] StreamExecutionEnvironment rework + user class loader fix for
cluster deployment 6867f9b93ec1ad9a627450c4fbd0b5ff98ef6148
[FLINK-1235] Compiler accepts iterations referenced from the static path of
other iterations 21b1b975ccb50e1831172894bde96c6d3269dc57

Hi,

DFF seems to be an interesting tool. There is no Flink support for it yet,
but it should be possible to use it as a back-end.

Thank you Stephan!

Now its time to merge the Akka/Jobmanager rework into the master.

@Henry: I'm trying to tag the JIRAs with the correct version. So you should
be able to find the issues fixed in the release.

I would also like to include the fix for
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-1333 into the release. Its
probably only a few lines.

It seems to depend on the issue ;)
"FLINK-1074" is the first hit on google.
Searching for "site:issues.apache.org/jira FLINK" will show you which
issues are indexed.

I can recommend searching for JIRAs with google mail ;)

I agree with Ufuk.
I'm uncertain if its a good idea to delay the 0.8.0 for these "last minute"
streaming features.
I have the impression that the current master is really stable and very
well tested. If we now bring in some prototypes and last minute features,
we probably end up discussing a 0.8.1 bugfix release in two weeks.
I would prefer a 0.8.0 release asap because it has already been way to long
with the issues unfixed in 0.7.0. Also, if the graduation is going to
happen soon, we'll be unable to release for two weeks or so because INFRA
has to transfer us to new namespace (mailing lists, website domain, release
spaces, ... )


As a general lesson from this discussion, we still have to improve our
communication to get a better mutual understanding of what we are working
on. I'll create a wiki page today that contains a roadmap of the features
we are working on.

+1.

I think adding the TypeHints pull request to the release is a good idea.
This allows us to give users a workaround if the type extraction is not
working.

I'll have a look at the Hbase hadoop1 support.

If the bugfix release is going to include almost all commits of the current
0.8-SNAPSHOT version, we should consider releasing it as Flink 0.8.0.

The amount of required work for making a bugfix or a major release is
basically the same.

Yes. I also got the impression that you are looking for something slightly
different.

It is probably easier for you right now to "hack" something into the system
to get these statistics.

Hi guys,

I vote to make this issue a release blocker:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-1225
Two users ran into the issue within 2 days. The quickstart is mean to give
new users a good experience.

Hey Nils,

I have played around a bit with a little prototype. You can find the code
here: https://github.com/rmetzger/incubator-flink/tree/flink456 (its
another branch in my repo).
You can see the changes that I applied on top of Till's Akka branch here:
https://github.com/rmetzger/incubator-flink/compare/tillrohrmann:akka_scala...rmetzger:flink456?expand=1

What the code does is collecting statistics about each TaskManager in the
system. These stats are assembled into a "MetricsReport" which is send with
the periodical heartbeat to the JobManager. The JobManager stores the
latest MetricsReport for each TaskManager (in the Instance object for each
TM).
When the user accesses the TaskManager overview, the latest MetricsReport
is send as a JSONObject to the browser.

to test my changes, check out the code, build it
 mvn clean package -DskipTests -Dcheckstyle.skip=true
go into
cd
flink-dist/target/flink-0.8-incubating-SNAPSHOT-bin/flink-0.8-incubating-SNAPSHOT/
and start the web interface
/bin/start-local.sh

Go to localhost:8081, in the "TaskManager" view, you can see some metrics.
Here is a screenshot: http://img42.com/eNPve

I named my branch after this issue, as it is probably describing best what
we're working on here: FLINK-456
<https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-456>

As I said in the beginning, its really just a prototype. Let me know if you
have any further questions.
For the "per TaskManager" reports, we should probably integrate some more
statistics. Also, the presentation of the numbers is very very basic right
now. I think there are many good libraries for visualizing these kinds of
stats.
Also, the numbers currently represent only a "snapshot", however, some of
the numbers can be accumulated (read/write bytes of the io manager).
Another missing feature is storing a little history of numbers to visualize
metrics over time.

I'm trying to find time to look into "per job" metrics as well. They will
require a bit more infrastructure to distinguish them on the JobManager
side and to get them on the TaskManagers.


Best,
Robert

As possible workarounds, you could
a) Implement your own serialization by implementing the "Value" interface.
b) Use the Hadoop
http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.3.0/api/org/apache/hadoop/io/MapWritable.html
MapWritable Class. You have to use hadoop's LongWritable and IntWritable
for the types of the map but Flink should be able to handle Writable's in
POJOs.

I would recommend option b).

I'm idling on #flink @ freenode. (I guess thats the place where most of the
Apache Projects have their channel).
What do we have to do to "get" the channel?

During a recent PR of the streaming scala api [1] arose the issue of
possibly changing the project structure. For the discussion it seems to me
that we should address this as a separate issue. Things to note:

   * According to Stephan for the batch part, there are discussions
to combine the "flink-core", "flink-java" projects, possibly also the
"flink-scala" project. We are starting to see too many interdependencies.
[2]
   * Streaming is currently under flink-addons, but we are positive that
for the next version we can come up with a fairly stable api if needed. We
would like to have it top level eventually.
   * Minor issue to keep in mind: Developing our projects with both scala
and java nature seems a bit flaky at the moment at least for Eclipse. [3]
Proposed solutions are also there, just let us make sure to give new
developers a smooth experience with Flink.

I personally like the following suggestion: [2]

We could, in the next version, go for something like
- flink-core (core and batch, java & scala)
- flink-streaming (java & scala)
- flink-runtime
- ...

Ufuk also +1'd this.

As currently the merge of [1] is blocking further streaming development (it
also contains some refactor) I'd like to merge it asap to where it is
currently (flink-scala), and let us figure out the project restructure
separately. Added a JIRA for the latter. [4] If we choose to restructure
the project it will need a commit anyway.

[1] https://github.com/apache/incubator-flink/pull/275
[2] https://github.com/apache/incubator-flink/pull/275#issuecomment-68049822

[4] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-1340

Please when replying vote and comment on the restructure and merge
separately.

Best,

Marton

Ok guys, then I also agree to skip 0.7.1 and go straight for 0.8.0. As for
the streaming side we would like to finish a couple of features (lambda 8
support, type handling rework, filesystems i/o support, at least once fault
tolerance prototype). I'm confident that we can get most of the things that
we really want in there done by the end of this week.

Cheers,

Marton

@Timo&Stephan: The streaming code uses this since last week [1], Timo
starting working on the issue prior way before that - so it also has to do
with the streaming team pushing last minute features to be honest...

Then are we waiting for the Java Clousure cleaner and the Kyro support, I
guess.
Aljoscha has already issued a PR for the former, some additional testing is
needed from the looks of it. [2]

+1 for sticking to the absolute minimum number of bugfix commits
+1 for pushing out 0.8.0 soon

As for streaming including only the one commit you mentioned [1] seems
sufficient.

[1] [streaming] StreamExecutionEnvironment rework + user class loader fix
for
cluster deployment 6867f9b93ec1ad9a627450c4fbd0b5ff98ef6148

It is a bit unclear for me how to proceed with this issue. If I understand
it correctly the votes were more for a smaller bugfix release than for
adding most of the code since 0.7.0, but correct me if I'm wrong.

Robert and Till assembled the following list fot commits to be included
then:

[FLINK-1154] Quickfix to kill TaskManagers in YARN mode.
 e46d14b4c7507b23f2c80e0d893cfff6f6c49bae
[runtime] CaseClassSerializer correctly treated as stateful
f66892d46d80d453a55fd0ae14095ee06275a55d
[runtime] Quick fix for error with unsupported ship strategy
87497b7235088b2220aa356a14cbff9d43d5dffb
[FLINK-1265] Fix user classloader bug for registerInputOutput() method
4a74f3281bd04ed76b911d2038ea8e3d9c0b7963
[FLINK-1252] Add support for serializing Date and Enums in the Java API
591f16dd8f80cc2a5b2fdc6654c3c2d625119faa
[FLINK-1251] Enums are now handled properly by the collection input format
8081ddc530e6c7b720da09ac0fca2095d70fdd36
[FLINK-1254] [compiler] Fix compiler bug for pipeline breaker placement
ce822bf7f5ec80df5d5a749b1439320af3fb8b18
[streaming] StreamExecutionEnvironment rework + user class loader fix for
cluster deployment 6867f9b93ec1ad9a627450c4fbd0b5ff98ef6148
[FLINK-1235] Compiler accepts iterations referenced from the static path of
other iterations 21b1b975ccb50e1831172894bde96c6d3269dc57
Removed TypeSerializerFactory from ScalaCsvInputFormat. The TypeSerializer
is now serialized directly. 3d242fd7aea6add18465d628a258be11def2d0af

And of course the doc fixes that are alredy on the release-0.7 branch. I'd
like to push these to the release-0.7 branch and fork release-0.7.1 from it
then.

Cheers,

Marton

+1 on quickstart, I'm having a look at it tomorrow.

Robert also pointed out the the DISCLAIMER file (for incubation, currently
also added to the distribution) is no longer needed neither on the master
nor on the release branch. Other minor things in the repo regarding the
graduation:

  * Eliminating the incubating subscript from the project version
  * Updating the the docs (mostly mentioned in variables, sometimes in
since given version that should not be changed)
  * Updating the quickstart scripts (more related to simply releasing)

I'm deleting the DISCLAIMER from the repo and the assemblies, bumping the
version and updating the parts of the docs that can be done prior to the
release.

As for the state of the relese: With the help of Robert I have acquired the
necessary knowledge and set up the tools needed for the release. I have
still minor issues with maven, but I'm confident that the solution is near.
I also fell motivated to write down my experiences in a documentation to
spare some time for up and coming release managers.

Best,

Marton

Hey, it is nice that the new website is in place however I'm curious why
the comparison with Spark got replace with Hadoop. :)

Hey,

Sorry for the late answer. We delayed the fault tolerance issue for 0.9,
the lambda expression support is here [1] and also contains the refactor on
serialization (which I wrongly mentioned as type handling). The commit on
filesystems is also pretty much ready, but I have not tested it on the
cluster yet. Can push it tomorrow morning. That is all from the streaming
side that was in question for 0.8.

Would you like to have the major changes Robert mentioned in 0.8?
(https://github.com/apache/incubator-flink/pull/149,
https://github.com/apache/incubator-flink/pull/254)

Thanks,

Hey,

As you may know in some European countries Santa Claus comes on the 6th of
December, Saint Nicolas Day - from Finland.

As Flink is not yet very active in Finland our Sweden team stepped in and
gave us a big present with a huge rework on the windowing semantics - this
is the implementation of the ideas that were posed the Stockholm hackathon
in October.

Big thanks to Jonas, Paris and Gyula. Jonas is posting a detailed intro to
the new features here soon.

Marton

The hangout was not recorded, so I'm providing a short write-up on the
issues and decisions. The discussion was 2 hours long, so please feel free
to add the important statements I have missed.

The initial ideas are listed on the project wiki as Flink Streaming
roadmap. [1] The hangout yielded the following additions:

   * Fault tolerance: We have a (mostly) working prototype not yet merged
for at least once semantics, that works similarly to Storm. A missing
feature on the streaming side is vertex restarts in the ExecutionGraph,
which will be made easier with Ufuk's intermediate results [2] pull
request, which will be merged after the 0.8 release. As for exactly once
semantics the preferred option was upstream backup, which is conceptually
the same as backtracking until an intermediate result is found - given that
intermediate results are stored at every vertex.

   * A common pipeline architecture for batch and streaming: The original
idea was to have just one ExecutionEnvironment which can convert DataSets
to DataStreams and vice versa. Gyula hacked together a small prototype
where a DataSet was fed into a DataStream, but for seamless integration
large refactor would have been needed. Stephan stepped in with the idea
that most likely only the DataSet to DataStream option should be supported
and initially let's work it through materializing the batch result in some
in-memory abstraction or even files. This would results in building
separate batch and streaming JobGraphs, and thus addressing optimization,
fault tolerance etc. separately. Gyula mentioned Chiwan Park's pending PR
on using HDFS updates as a streaming source as a possible solution for
feeding the results of recurring batch jobs into streaming.

   * API integrations: We've just added java 8 support to the streaming API
and started working on the Scala API as well, which seems to be a low
hanging fruit standing on Aljoscha's shoulder. A next step would be also
adding the Python API and building on that providing a notebook-like "IDE",
with e.g. Zeppelin. [4] This is also (in fact mainly) interesting for batch
processing. For further integrations a scala shell should be really useful.
According to Stephan the latter should not be too challenging, mostly API
and some Scheduler work is required.

   * Multiparadigm (batch & streaming) ML: Opening to the machine learning
direction Paris and Vasia took up the SAMOA [5] integration issue, which
would provide streaming machine learning support and also comparability
with Storm, S4 and Samza. Kostas mentioned that the Mahout port to Flink is
also an on-going effort.

Further topics included the state of the 0.8 release, for which the first
release candidate should come next week; the streaming windowing rework
lead by Jonas [6], and conceptional comparison of Spark and Flink initiated
by Henry.

Special thanks to Mayur for tuning in despite of being around midnight in
India and providing valuable insight on Tachyon.

It would be nice to have integration with the existing tools, e.g. Ganglia.
[1] These already cover system statistics, (CPU, network, I/O...) and one
can define own stats to monitor.
Hadoop is nicely integrated with it.

Robert's Kryo PR is the last outstanding feature patch.
I'd like to stick to bugfixing that pops up during the tests. Speaking of
which today we've had a look at the streaming code with Gyula for the
release and produced a couple of commits.

We will manually rebase anything else that is needed for the release.

Hey,

Checking the PRs listed by Stephan it seems every import one has been
merged. As for the optional ones the following two are still pending:


Add support for Subclasses, Interfaces, Abstract Classes as POJOs

[FLINK-1245] Introduce TypeHints for Java API operators


Robert +1'd the TypeHints PR and Timo has just updated it. Should we wait
for it?

Cheers,

Marton

Dear Flink dev.

Thanks for this great system. I tried to set up the quickstart project, but
I run into the following issue. After

mvn clean package

The jar file are almost empty

ls -l target/*.jar
-rw-r--r--  1 philippe  staff   382 18 d=C3=A9c 14:08
target/quickstart-0.1-flink-fat-jar.jar
-rw-r--r--  1 philippe  staff  5985 18 d=C3=A9c 14:08 target/quickstart-0.1.jar

And they do not contain the main() class. I guess that this is related to
the maven assembly options, but a few changes there were not successful.

So before trying to hack further, do you have any advice? I am using
Mac OS, java 7.

Thanks in advance

Philippe

I agree. It would be nice if

Is there a performance-critical commit, which would be *more* work to back
port than the other commits? If not, I don't see any reason to exclude them.

I agree +1. The big changes you pointed out are a very good point for
releasing 0.8.0 now. :-) It also makes it much easier (no cherry picking
etc.) ;-)

Hey Vikas! Welcome to the community :-)

I would suggest the following: have a look at the how to contribute guide
on the webpage and familiarize yourself with the user-facing APIs (i.e. the
examples). I think these two points will be a good general intro.

Also have a look at the our JIRA. We have tagged the system components.
Have a look and figure out which componts interest you the most. This will
make it easier to find issues matching your interests.

Hey Kostas,

I just saw a related issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-1089

You can close it after the SVN repo is working again and you pushed the
website.

Have you also thought about adding the statistics collection with the
writers, i.e. the collector or record writer?

If all you care about is the data that the user emits from her code, that
should be fine.

This sounds like a lot. I can understand that you want as much in a release
as possible though. ;) Would it make sense to reduce this list to the most
important changes and keep the rest for 0.8.1?

Very nice :-) after we merge the akka code I can rebase my code on it and
we should be (almost) fine to merge my changes as well.

The first two PRs are still open. I will have a look at them as well
(Robert already tested one).

@Robert:
Regarding the Hbase PR: Is it resolved by 1b69749 ("Enable flink-hbase
module for hadoop1 build as well")?


It would be nice if had a look at the remaining important ones today. :-)

+1 I like that idea. Maybe you should open a separate thread or issue for
it. :-)

I think it is reasonable to have new major versions for new major features.
Since we don't have any new major features, we should stick to 0.7.1.

I would actually say that a bugfix release requires more work. ;-)

Hi,

I have the same import errors so that I can not build successfully in
Eclipse Luna.

For example, some class
e.g.org.apache.flink.runtime.messages.ExecutionGraphMessages,
org.apache.flink.runtime.akka.AkkaUtils
can not be found.

So, how to fix it?

Cheers!

Hi Robert,

Yeah I am thinking of registering #flink @ free node.

We could do it ourselves I believe as long as that channel is available.

Should we go with #flink, #asfflink, or #apacheflink as name of the channel?
Other suggestion is welcomed.

I like the new bold layout =)

Instead of "Hadoop Integrated" maybe we could use something like "Play

Thx Stephan, will try it out.

Sharing a workaround I use so far, in IntelliJ you could modify the
Run/Debug configuration to remove the "make" step and do mvn from
console before runninbug local in the IDE.

It's extensibility is one of the reasons it has been used in other projects.

Nice! So do we have official list of JIRA and PRs will be in 0.8? I do
not see the conclusions in the other thread.

Does this mean no more patches for 0.8 release or you and Marton will
manually rebase them?

HI All,

I just realized that to build Flink for Hadoop 2 I could no longer run this:

  mvn clean package -DskipTests -Dhadoop.profile=2

it barfed with error:

[INFO] Scanning for projects...
[ERROR] The build could not read 1 project -> [Help 1]

I now have to do run 'mvn clean package -DskipTests -Phadoop-2'
command to set the hbase-version properly and pull the right
dependencies.

Was there any major Maven pom.xml updates?

Ok I saw #flink registered. I also have registered #apacheflink just in case.
But we could go with #flink at irc.freenode.org (or via
http://webchat.freenode.net) for now since most ASF projects do not
have Apache or ASF prefix.

With all the discussions winding down and seemed like we have positive
responses I will send another email to confirm the "official" channel
for Flink and update the website to reflect it.

Thanks everyone.

HI All,

Sorry for cross posting.

I thinking about setting up ASF official IRC channel for Apache Flink.

Some of us could just hang out and provide answer or just ask for
question about Flink casually.

The channel could also be used for some "official" discussions which
can be recorded and shared in the dev@ list.

If there are some interests about it I could start working on it.

I found this is useful in other projects such as Bigtop , Aurora, and Tachyon

Hi Robert,

>From I have seen it so far, it is probably better and easier for Flink
to leverage metrics library [1] for the metrics collection rather than
building organically.

Several ASF projects like Spark [2] and Tajo have used it with great success.

One of the main reasons is maintainability and the breath of types of
metric could and should be collected.

Thanks for the update Marton.

So with we are graduating it is coming as blessing but unfortunately
adding more work to the release process.

Please do let us know if you need any help with the release.

Hi Guys,

I finally have time to look at this. Could you create a design
document to share how would you approach this feature?

There are 2 parts I guess, one is the metrics collection itself and
second is publishing to external either via JMX to external service.

We could use Metrics [1] aka codahale's metrics library to do it.

HI All,

Per discussion in Flink dev mailing list, we now have official #flink
chat room at irc.freenode.org.

Feel free to stop by to ask anything or share some ideas that could be
contributed to Apache Flink.

I will be making update to the website to reflect the information [1]


Thanks,

Henry

We actually need to bring these work come to light early so we could
give feedback before getting to deep.

Marton, could you encourage Paris and Jonas to publish or share their
thoughts about the work they are doing?

Would love to give some feedbacks.

If people are ok, I propose to do the 6pm (CET) to make sure Stephan
can join too.

Would that still work for everybody?

Does Kostas or Robert know how to record hangout to publish it to
mailing list as before? I assume we will do Google hangout?

Thanks Gyula,

Just checking it will be 8:30am PST?

To make it more productive please have some kind of simple design doc or
proposal with preso style to help us discuss each proposed work.

Following the apache way, we then need to create Jira ticket and attach it
for other whom cannot attend the hangout to review and chime in.
Any Final decisions need to happen in dev list via emails or comments in
Jira.

When reviewing Robert's patch for generalizing Hadoop compatible FS I
just noticed there are some class names that are exactly the same as
Hadoop, such as FSDataInputStream or Configuration, which makes
programming a bit awkward when trying to use both in one class.
Hence we see a lot of full class named used such as
org.apache.hadoop.fs.FSDataInputStream.

Is the name conflicts intentional or just naming convention?
We could just Prefixed with "Flink" for all those classes that
conflict with Java IO or Hadoop. So instead of FSDataInputStream we
could have FlinkDataInputStream.

Thoughts?

Related to Zeppelin [1], looks like it is sponsored/ developed by a
company in Korea [2] that has nothing to do with football
unfortunately (I thought they were the same team that does
http://www.nfl.com/stats/statslab),
I was kinda disappointed at the beginning =3DP

But anyway seemed like integration with Flink would be considered as
potential next one  =3D)

Just want to make sure I clear up my comments in the hangout.

ASF has bot that could record history and send report:
http://www.apache.org/dev/asfbot.html

We will use it when we use our IRC channel for discussions. But the
idea is to allow community to just hang out and converse.

Did you create one in irc.freenode.org?

Thanks to Kostas for bringing the discussions to the community and I
believe Apache Flink is ready for graduation as top level project.

There are more and great things the community want to do, and I
believe being ASF top level project (TLP) will better position Flink
to grow the community.

The Apache Flink has had several good releases, several good reports,
and had invited new committers/PPMCs that demonstrates the community
understands how to operate in Apache way.

The most important thing is that the community has a lot of passion
and desire to continue journey as ASF top level project.

The proposed time on Friday is fine for me as well. Both 9 PST and 8:30 PST

Sorry for the delay, but here comes a short introduction for the new
features!

We are glad to announce that we've introduced newly developed and high
flexible windowing semantics in flink-streaming.

Flink-streaming allows now to define windows using policies. There are two
types of policies, Trigger- and Eviction-policies. The trigger policy
specifies when the reduce function gets executed on the current element
buffer (respectively the current window) and the result gets emitted. The
eviction policy specifies when elements get removed from the buffer (window
size).

We provide a wide range of pre-defined policies, such as count-based,
time-based, punctuation-based and delta-based.
Punctuation allows to specify windows externally by putting flags at some
elements in the stream. Delta-policies can apply a distance measure to
decide when to trigger or evict.

Using the provided set of predefined policies users can already define a
huge variate of windows. For example:

   - Hold elements of the last 5 seconds, while the user defined
   aggregation/reduce is executed on the windows every second (sliding the
   window by 1 second):
      - dataStream.window(Time.of(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)).every(Time.of(1,
      TimeUnit.SECONDS))


   - Downsample our stream: Take the latest 100 elements of our stream
   every minute:
      - dataStream.window(Count.of(100)).every(Time.of(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES))


   - Using combinations of multiple different policies, we can go even
   further:
      - Every 5 minutes give me the aggregations of the last 1 mio.
      elements but never include elements older than 10 minutes.
      - Emit every 5 minutes, but immediately in case the current value
      differs more than X% from the last one.

Additionally, policies can be implemented as UDFs, which gives the user the
highest possible flexibility for the specification of windows.

The new policy based windowing can also be used for grouped streams.
For example: To get the maximal value by key on the last 100 elements we
use the following approach:

   -
   dataStream.window(Count.of(100)).every(=E2=80=A6).groupBy(groupingField).max(field);

To create fixed size windows for every key we need to reverse the order of
the groupBy call. So to take the max for the last 100 elements in Each
group:

   -
   dataStream.groupBy(groupingField).window(Count.of(100)).every(=E2=80=A6).max(field);

This will create separate windows for different keys and apply the trigger
and eviction policies on a per group basis.

We extended the streaming guide[1] with a documentation about the new
features. Additionally you can find several examples in the windowing
package[2].

Hi all!

Please find below a list of commits that I would propose to include in the
bugfix release.

It does not contain any streaming commits. Marton, Gyula, can you add that?

Thing is: it contains 90% of all commits. I put some in parenthesis that
are not bug fixes, but minor additions that are useful also in a minor
release.

We might as well just take all commits and make it 0.8.0 ;-)

Greetings,
Stephan

I am currently working through the type hints pull request...

Right now, I actually think that we should postpone this for the next
bugfix release.

This pull request changes actually some tricky mechanisms in the Java API
(it delays the type information), which may have implications that me and
Timo have not fully caught now.

I don't feel Merging this last minute - this is prone to introduce errors.

Any opinions on that?

I have to see whether I can make it, I might still be on my way back from
Amsterdam (giving a talk at the Netherlands Hadoop User Group). I might be
a bit late and only join at 6pm (CET) / 9am (PST)

Hi Wilson!

You can start by mocking an outer join operator using a special CoGroup
function. If one of the two sides for a group is empty, you have the case
where you need to append null values. Otherwise, you build the Cartesian
produce within the group.

For a proper through-the-stack implementation (not sure if that is needed,
but may be nice to have), have a look here:

http://flink.incubator.apache.org/docs/0.7-incubating/internal_add_operator.html

Greetings,
Stephan

Wow, good news :-)

Saint Nicolas had the help of his Finish elves Parisson, Gyulafred, and
Jonasson ?

Hi!

I forked a branch "release-0.8" and bumped the master version to
"0.9-incubating-SNAPSHOT".

The closure cleaner is merged. Robert has opened a PR for Kryo - I would
suggest to merge that to "master", cherry-pick to "release-0.8" and then:
Merry releasing!

Greetings,
Stephan

Hi all!

As per discussion in a separate thread, I forked the release branch
(release-0.8 - for testing and release candidates) and bumped the master to
"0.9-incubating-SNAPSHOT".

Greetings,
Stephan

I think you have to essentially do the same thing: register a compiler
plugin.

Maybe one of the IntelliJ users knows more details...

Yes, the fact that we both did not realize that until now sort of reveals
that there are more implications than anticipated. That is never good for
"last minute" patches.

That's why I would like to merge it into 0.8.1 and 0.9, rather than 0.8.0
That gives the code a bit more testing/use and us a bit more time to
thoroughly think the implications through.

Hi!

The type hints PR is ready now, Timo made some final adjustments yesterday
evening. I'll review and merge it now, then we can fork the branch.

Cheers,
Stephan

Hey!

You can try setting the minimum split size of the file input format so
large that only one split per file gets created.

You can probably reuse the delimited input Format when you choose a
delimiter that does not exist as a character sequence in the file. But just
reading the file stream into a string builder (through a reader that
decodes the charset) is probably quite straightforward as well.

It may make sense to add an option to the file input format to not split up
files...

Stephan

That actually sounds like a great idea. I discussed a bit with Robert
offline on Friday, and it seems that Metrics has most of what we talked
about.

I also like the way they make it extensible, so people can capture their
own metrics.

These are good findings. We should write them down in the Readme.md

Marton,

As far as I understood, this is relevant for the master, not for the 0.8
release, correct?

In that case, I suggest to go ahead with the option you voted for (which is
also supported at least by Ufuk and me as well). If we discover downsides,
we will be able to correct this in the course of the next weeks, well
before the next release.

Greetings,
Stephan

If you use Flink's LongValue, StringValue, DoubleValue, you can also use
Flink's MapValue. If you subclass it (without adding code) it is very
efficient. It stores type information in the subclass and that way handles
key and value types.

We are in the midst of replacing Avro in the serialization, so this should
spoon be fixed properly.

Until then, you could try to re-package the collection. Something like an
array of map entries, or so. Would that feasible?

Would it be simpler to list what we not include? I think most of the stuff
added since then is fixes, not fundamental features. I would include almost
all of it, also the closure cleaner, the type fixes, ...

Hi!

For all those that have (or have had) problems getting the Scala Project
with all the Macro Magic to work in Eclipse, here is an FAQ entry for that:

https://github.com/apache/incubator-flink/blob/master/docs/faq.md#in-eclipse-i-get-compilation-errors-in-the-scala-projects

Relevant to 0.8-SNAPSHOT code, should be on the website with the next major
release.

Hey!

Good to hear, so we could feature-freeze the 0.8 branch tomorrow or
Wednesday and focus on testing and remaining bug fixes?

The two big pull requests Robert mentioned should not go into 0.8 in my
opinion (and I think Till and Ufuk who created them are on the same page),
because they will probably need a few additional
weeks of continuous testing until we are confident that they are in a
release ready state.

Hi all!

If anyone is interested in heading a very cool issue (or almost a
standalone subproject), have a look here:

Stephan

-----

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-1319
Description

Flink's Optimizer takes information that tells it for UDFs which fields of
the input elements are accessed, modified, or forwarded/copied. This
information frequently helps to reuse partitionings, sorts, etc. It may
speed up programs significantly, as it can frequently eliminate sorts and
shuffles, which are costly.

Right now, users can add lightweight annotations to UDFs to provide this
information (such as adding @ConstandFields("0->3, 1, 2->1").

We worked with static code analysis of UDFs before, to determine this
information automatically. This is an incredible feature, as it "magically"
makes programs faster.

For record-at-a-time operations (Map, Reduce, FlatMap, Join, Cross), this
works surprisingly well in many cases. We used the "Soot" toolkit for the
static code analysis. Unfortunately, Soot is LGPL licensed and thus we did
not include any of the code so far.

I propose to add this functionality to Flink, in the form of a drop-in
addition, to work around the LGPL incompatibility with ALS 2.0. Users could
simply download a special "flink-code-analysis.jar" and drop it into the
"lib" folder to enable this functionality. We may even add a script to
"tools" that downloads that library automatically into the lib folder. This
should be legally fine, since we do not redistribute LGPL code and only
dynamically link it (the incompatibility with ASL 2.0 is mainly in the
patentability, if I remember correctly).

Prior work on this has been done by Aljoscha Krettek
<https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=aljoscha>
and Sebastian
Kunert <https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=skunert>,
which could provide a code base to start with.

Hey!

I sort of agree with Ufuk. Type system rework easily leads to followup
issues. I suspect that if we wait for that, there is not going to be a
release before Christmas.

How essential is that functionality? Is the streaming API fundamentally
broken without that, or is it rather a set of features that define the next
big step? For issues that fall into the first category, let's prioritize
and include them. But for issues in the second category, I think it is fine
to postpone them to the next release (which we may want to do rather soon
after).

Hi everyone!

I would suggest to fork a 0.8 release branch very soon, to not stall the
development of features that go into 0.9. The new Akka based coordination
and the network stack extensions are required for many new features which
are in the pipeline.

How about we merge the below listed pull requests into the master, and then
branch the 0.8 release branch off and bump the master version to
0.9-SNAPSHOT.

After we have forked the release branch, Marton (as release manager) would
create release candidates and collect status of the tests and patches. We
can fix bugs on the release branch and cherry-pick the patches to the
0.9-SNAPSHOT branch.

----------------------------------------------
Important Pull Requests to merge:
----------------------------------------------

[FLINK-1287] LocalizableSplitAssigner prefers splits with less degrees of
freedom

Fixed java quickstart example

[FLINK-998] Close TCP connections after destroying logical channels

[FLINK-1302] Make JDBCInputFormat implement the NonParallelInput interface

[FLINK-1305] [FLINK-1304] Test for HadoopInputWrapper and NullWritable
support

Upgraded HBase addon to HBase 0.98.x and new Tuple APIs + fix of
ExecutionEnvironment
(this is partially merged, there are a few POM entries missing for Hadoop 1
support)


----------------------------------------------
Optional Pull Requests to merge:
----------------------------------------------

Add support for Subclasses, Interfaces, Abstract Classes as POJOs

[FLINK-1245] Introduce TypeHints for Java API operators

enable CSV Reader to ignore invalid lines like an empty line at the end and
comments - FLINK-1208


Please veto the important pull requests (if they should not go in) and +1
or -1 the optional ones, as you deem fitting.


Greetings,
Stephan

Yes, one thing I just realized is that the streaming API is not aware of
MissingTypeInfos and it may cause weird behavior.

So what do we do now? Can we narrow down what features we want to merge
still?

In any case, it would be good to branch off the 0.8 release branch soon, as
we have major changes waiting to be merged that should only go into the
next major version (0.9).

I don't know any workaround. But maybe Avro should be avoided
altogether for your requirements.

What is the data that you want to move between operations?

I uploaded a screenshot of my Scala compiler config in IntelliJ:
http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2eqcu2s&s=8

The essential thing is that the "Additional Compiler Options" field
must be free while the macro paradise plugin is added to the list of
compiler plugins.

Hope that helps.

for the irc channel yesterday but couldn't find.

Hi all,
        I'm Vikas Mishra a undergrad student from India and I just wanted
to introduce myself to the community since I want to start contributing. I
have been contributing to many open source projects and most of them have
been in Python but I don't mind working in Java as well.  I was also a
Google Summer of Code 2014 student for OSGeo, but I have always wanted to
try my hands on Big data/Data science and have been reading about projects
on the same, and came to know about Flink/Stratosphere. I liked it a lot
and would now love to start contributing to the project.

It would really help a lot if anyone of the developers can mentor me and
point me to some HOWTO's or getting started pages and suggest some first
bug for me to start.

I hope to meet some really great people here and am looking forward to a
great learning experience here at Flink.

As Gyula described, the combination of scala 2.10.4 with paradise_2.10.4-2.0.1 as a compiler plugin worked for me as well for both the scala IDE and Intellij 14 CE.

In case an Intellij user finds it useful, I did things in the following order:

1) mvn clean package
2) (re)importing the project in intellij
3) adding scala 2.10.4 under Project Structure->Global Libraries
4) adding the path to paradise_2.10.4-2.0.1.jar (got it via maven) under General->Build,Execution,Deployment->Compiler->Scala Compiler-Compiler Plugins

I just found out that there is a reference already in the faq [1] regarding the compilation issue.

Subject: Re: Eclipse import errors after akka update

Hey,

The easiest fix for the eclipse issues is to avoid using luna and instead
use the eclipse scala-ide (which you can also use for java development,
this is what I do). This is basically an eclipse kepler with preinstalled
scala plugins which are actually working.

You can download it from here:
http://scala-ide.org/download/prev-stable.html

Make sure you download the version for Scala 2.10
<http://download.scala-ide.org/sdk/helium/e38/scala210/stable/site>.

When you imported the project the last thing to do is to set the compiler
plugin for the flink-scala project as described by till:
" You have to specify it in Properties (Module) -> Scala compiler ->
Advanced -> Xplugin.
You should find the paradise jar in your local maven repository, if you
built the project at least once with maven: Something like
~/.m2/repository/org/scalamacros/paradise_2.10.4/2.
0.1/paradise_2.10.4-2.0.1.jar."

I hope this helps, worked fine for me and others.

Cheers,
Gyula

Hello!

I agree that refactoring project structure is necessary. But there are some pull requests influenced by this change such as #275 [1], #226 [2]. I think that we would better merge these pull requests before refactoring.

[1] https://github.com/apache/incubator-flink/pull/275 <https://github.com/apache/incubator-flink/pull/275>
[2] https://github.com/apache/incubator-flink/pull/226 <https://github.com/apache/incubator-flink/pull/226>

Our documentation currently lacks some advice on how to write Flink applications efficiently and how to tune Flink.

          Issue Type: New Feature
          Components: YARN Client
            Reporter: Robert Metzger


Currently, Flink users can only launch Flink on YARN as a "YARN session" (meaning a long-running YARN application that can run multiple Flink jobs)

Users have requested to extend the Flink Client to allocate YARN containers only for executing a single job.

As part of this pull request, I would suggest to refactor the YARN Client to make it more modular and object oriented.

            Assignee: Stephan Ewen
             Fix For: 0.8-incubating


Currently, very large records (multiple hundreds of megabytes) can break the sorter if the overflow the sort buffer.

Furthermore, if a merge is attempted of those records, pulling multiple of them concurrently into memory can break the machine memory.

            Reporter: Alexander Alexandrov
            Assignee: Alexander Alexandrov
             Fix For: 0.8-incubating


One of the major problems related to the optimizer at the moment is the lack of proper statistics.

With the introduction of staged execution, it is possible to instrument the runtime code with a statistics facility that collects the required information for optimizing the next execution stage.

I would therefore like to contribute code that can be used to gather basic statistics for the (intermediate) result of dataflows (e.g. min, max, count, count distinct) and make them available to the job manager.

Before I start, I would like to hear some feedback form the other users.

In particular, to handle skew (e.g. on grouping) it might be good to have some sort of detailed sketch about the key distribution of an intermediate result. I am not sure whether a simple histogram is the most effective way to go. Maybe somebody would propose another lightweight sketch that provides better accuracy.

Right now, we use setContextClassLoader() and getContextClassLoader() in some places and in other places we implicitly pass the ClassLoader around. This is not consistent and in some places we might not be sure where to get the class loader from.

                 URL: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-1299
             Project: Flink
          Issue Type: Improvement
          Components: Build System
            Reporter: Ufuk Celebi
            Priority: Minor


Currently, the default config contains fixed values for both the job manager and the task manager heap sizes. I propose to comment both lines out and let the JVM set -Xms and -Xms automatically.

This should give a better out of the box experience when trying out Flink locally or on a cluster.

There is currently
{{flink-core:org.apache.flink.core.memory.DataInputViewStream}}
and
{{flink-java:org.apache.flink.api.java.typeutils.runtime.DataInputViewStream}}

CAVEAT: They implement a different variant of reading a byte: one reads unsigned, the other reads signed. Might be that one of the variants is wrong.

There are several files in our source distribution without proper AL2 license headers, including .md, .html, .css, .svg files in the documentation, and .scala files in the scala-quickstart.

These files are not found due to rather coarse-grained excludes configuration of the Maven Rat plugin.

There are no methods required for implementing the interface. Its just a maker for the optimizer.

It fails because the HadoopInputFormat uses the Flink Tuple2 type. For this, type extraction fails at runtime.

NullWritable is a special object that is commonly used in Hadoop applications. NullWritable does not provide a public constructor, but only a singleton factory method. Therefore Flink fails when users to try to read NullWritables from Hadoop sequencefiles.

The program that fails in the optimizer is from a user. I have not been able to reduce it significantly into a standalone test case that reproduces the bug.

With the current implementation of the CSVInputFormat, quoted string parsing kicks in, if the first non-whitespace character of a field is a double quote. 

I see two issues with this implementation:
1. Quoted String parsing cannot be disabled
2. The quoting character is fixed to double quotes (")

I propose to add parameters to disable quoted String parsing and set the quote character.

            Priority: Minor


Flink's Optimizer takes information that tells it for UDFs which fields of the input elements are accessed, modified, or frwarded/copied. This information frequently helps to reuse partitionings, sorts, etc. It may speed up programs significantly, as it can frequently eliminate sorts and shuffles, which are costly.

Right now, users can add lightweight annotations to UDFs to provide this information (such as adding {{@ConstandFields("0->3, 1, 2->1")}}.

We worked with static code analysis of UDFs before, to determine this information automatically. This is an incredible feature, as it "magically" makes programs faster.

For record-at-a-time operations (Map, Reduce, FlatMap, Join, Cross), this works surprisingly well in many cases. We used the "Soot" toolkit for the static code analysis. Unfortunately, Soot is LGPL licensed and thus we did not include any of the code so far.

I propose to add this functionality to Flink, in the form of a drop-in addition, to work around the LGPL incompatibility with ALS 2.0. Users could simply download a special "flink-code-analysis.jar" and drop it into the "lib" folder to enable this functionality. We may even add a script to "tools" that downloads that library automatically into the lib folder. This should be legally fine, since we do not redistribute LGPL code and only dynamically link it (the incompatibility with ASL 2.0 is mainly in the patentability, if I remember correctly).

Prior work on this has been done by [~aljoscha] and [~skunert], which could provide a code base to start with.

             Summary: Add an off-heap variant of the managed memory
                 Key: FLINK-1320
                 URL: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-1320
             Project: Flink

          Components: Local Runtime
            Reporter: Stephan Ewen
            Priority: Minor


For (nearly) all memory that Flink accumulates (in the form of sort buffers, hash tables, caching), we use a special way of representing data serialized across a set of memory pages. The big work lies in the way the algorithms are implemented to operate on pages, rather than on objects.

The core class for the memory is the {{MemorySegment}}, which has all methods to set and get primitives values efficiently. It is a somewhat simpler (and faster) variant of a HeapByteBuffer.

As such, it should be straightforward to create a version where the memory segment is not backed by a heap byte[], but by memory allocated outside the JVM, in a similar way as the NIO DirectByteBuffers, or the Netty direct buffers do it.

This may have multiple advantages:
  - We reduce the size of the JVM heap (garbage collected) and the number and size of long living alive objects. For large JVM sizes, this may improve performance quite a bit. Utilmately, we would in many cases reduce JVM size to 1/3 to 1/2 and keep the remaining memory outside the JVM.
  - We save copies when we move memory pages to disk (spilling) or through the network (shuffling / broadcasting / forward piping)

The changes required to implement this are
  - Add a {{UnmanagedMemorySegment}} that only stores the memory adress as a long, and the segment size. It is initialized from a DirectByteBuffer.
  - Allow the MemoryManager to allocate these MemorySegments, instead of the current ones.
  - Make sure that the startup script pick up the mode and configure the heap size and the max direct memory properly.

Since the MemorySegment is probably the most performance critical class in Flink, we must take care that we do this right. The following are critical considerations:
  - If we want both solutions (heap and off-heap) to exist side-by-side (configurable), we must make the base MemorySegment abstract and implement two versions (heap and off-heap).
  - To get the best performance, we need to make sure that only one class gets loaded (or at least ever used), to ensure optimal JIT de-virtualization and inlining.
  - We should carefully measure the performance of both variants. From previous micro benchmarks, I remember that individual byte accesses in DirectByteBuffers (off-heap) were slightly slower than on-heap, any larger accesses were equally good or slightly better.

The Scala API does not have output methods which do not take a WriteMode parameter. As default value the NO_OVERWRITE is set. Consequently, a possible global WriteMode set in the configuration is always overwritten. The Java API behaves differently, if no WriteMode is provided. We should sync both APIs to guarantee consistent behaviour.

Flink currently allocates a sizeable chunk of the JVM heap for the framework, where hashing and sorting is done amongst others. This enables graceful spilling to disk, when this datasize exceeds memory, however might be counterproductive for jobs with large user state and is completely unutilized by streaming at the moment.

This happens for example when a sort feeds into a merge join and the merge join exits early (zig zag merge determined that it can stop).

You can reproduce this bug by running the transitive closure in Scala (or Java with an enforced merge join) using the following toy data set.

{code}
Path(2, 1),
Path(4, 1),
Path(6, 3),
Path(8, 3),
Path(10, 1),
Path(12, 1),
Path(14, 3),
Path(16, 3),
Path(18, 1),
Path(20, 1) );

          Issue Type: Improvement
          Components: Java API
            Reporter: Stephan Ewen


The Java API could really need a simple closure cleaner.

All functions that are implemented as anonymous subclasses hold a reference to the enclosing class, unless they are implemented as part of a static method.

That reference (called {{this$0}}) causes serialization to fail, as it draws non serializable classes into the function, even in cases where the function makes no access to the enclosing data.

It is possible to manually set this reference to {{null}}, using reflection, or using a debugger. Then the serialization succeeds.

I suggest to add a closure cleaner that uses an ASM visitor over the function's code to see if there is any access to the {{this$0}} field. In case there is non, the field should be set to {{null}}.

The problem can be reproduced with the simple program below:

{code}
public class Test {

  public void runProgram() throws Exception {
    ExecutionEnvironment env = ExecutionEnvironment .getExecutionEnvironment();

    env.generateSequence(1, 10)
        .map(new MapFunction<Long, Long>() {
          public Long map(Long value) {
            return value * 2;
          }
        })
        .print();

    env.execute();
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    new Test().runProgram();
  }
}
{code}

The SpanningRecordSerializer creates large byte arrays to buffer records during serialization. Since they never release the records, they may occupy a large amount of memory. Currently, we use one per output partition, which is due to the original architecture.

There are two ways to fix this:

 1. Use only one serializer per output, rather than one per output partition. This is the preferable way in the long run anyways.

 2. Release the arrays in the serializer (quick fix).

Constant field annotations are used by the optimizer to determine whether physical data properties such as sorting or partitioning are retained by user defined functions.

The current implementation is limited and can be extended in several ways:
- Fields that are copied to other positions
- Field definitions for non-tuple data types (Pojos)

There is a pull request (#83) that goes into this direction and which can be extended.

When building Flink, the build results can currently be found under "flink-root/flink-dist/target/flink-$FLINKVERSION-incubating-SNAPSHOT-bin/flink-$YARNVERSION-$FLINKVERSION-incubating-SNAPSHOT/".

I think we could improve the directory layout with the following:

- provide the bin folder in the root by default
- let the start up and submissions scripts in bin assemble the class path
- in case the project hasn't been build yet, inform the user

The changes would make it easier to work with Flink from source.

Running the Flink examples should be super simple.

- provide a script in bin called run-example.sh
- skip the entry class path, i.e. WordCount runs org.apache.flink.examples.java.wordcount.WordCount
- provide default parameters and setup instructions
- automatically set up a local execution when no cluster configuration has been found

We are writing some code for a student homework that reads two broadcast sets in the open method of a RichMapFunction.

We are seeing inconsistent behavior, sometimes the code works, sometimes it deadlocks, sometimes it crashes with an OutOfMemoryError...

It has been some month now, since I started implementing a runtime-operator for Flink the fist time. Thereby, I discovered that there is no good introduction to the concepts/programming model of the flink runtime. Anyhow, it is necessary to have knowledge about this in order to implement a new operators.

There is a short documentation at [1], but this is not really sufficient.
I googled a bit and found [2] and [3]. Although, this documentation is not complete and possibly outdated at some points, it gave me good introduction.

It would be nice if the content could be updated and re-added to the documentation.

EMR offers bootstrap actions that prepare the cluster by installing additional components, etc..

We can offer a Flink bootstrap action that downloads, unpacks, and configures Flink. It may optionally install libraries that we like to use (such as Python, BLAS/JBLAS, ...)

For the 0.8 release and 0.9 snapshot, we can remove the {-incubating} from the release version.

We don't need the DISCLAIMER file anymore for releases

Also, the disclaimer on the website is not necessary anymore.

Found a hard-coded link to the 0.7-incubating doc version in one of the source files, namely in org.apache.flink.examples.java.misc.CollectionExecutionExample. A nicer solution would be to always point that to the latest documentation version.

    Affects Versions: 0.9
            Reporter: M=C3=A1rton Balassi


During a recent PR of the streaming scala api [1] arose the issue of possibly changing the project structure. For the discussion it seems to me that we should address this as a separate issue. Things to note:

   * According to Stephan for the batch part, there are discussions
to combine the "flink-core", "flink-java" projects, possibly also the "flink-scala" project. We are starting to see too many interdependencies. [2]
   * Streaming is currently under flink-addons, but we are positive that for the next version we can come up with a fairly stable api if needed. We would like to have it top level eventually.
   * Minor issue to keep in mind: Developing our projects with both scala and java nature seems a bit flaky at the moment at least for Eclipse. [3] Proposed solutions are also there, just let us make sure to give new developers a smooth experience with Flink.

I personally like the following suggestion: [2]

We could, in the next version, go for something like=20
- flink-core (core and batch, java & scala)=20
- flink-streaming (java & scala)=20
- flink-runtime=20
- ...

Ufuk also +1'd this.

I've added a quick solution for [1] for the time being. The assembly still filters out everything from the org.apache.flink namespace, so any user code placed there will be missing from the fat jar.

If we do not use filtering at all the size of the jar goes up to almost 100 MB.
